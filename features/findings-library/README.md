# Findings Library

The Findings Library lives at `/reporting/findings/`. The library is where users can view and edit finding templates for use in reports. Adding a finding to the library makes it available to all users. The library is intended to be the "source of truth" for your team when it comes to templates.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure everyone is aware that editing a finding in the library _changes it for everyone_. Edits for a specific project/report should be made after the finding is added to the report. Then edit the report's "local" copy.
{% endhint %}

# Reporting

Ghostwriter manages all data related to clients, projects, infrastructure, and findings/observations. There is a tremendous amount of reporting potential for historical data and end of project work \(e.g. client-facing reports\). That means _reporting_ is not limited to just rendering a report of findings from a project.

More built-in statistics will come soon, but you can run reports using Django or a task in `tasks.py` \(see [Background Tasks](../background-tasks/)\).
{% endhint %}

# Project Points of Contact & Assignments

The _People_ tab shows the project's team assignments, roles, and any notes for the assignment. Since team members can be assigned multiple times during the project (during different non-overlapping periods), this tab and the project calendar are excellent references for who will join the project, when, and in what capacity.

This tab also tracks the project's points of contact. Clients have points of contact, but not all client contacts may be relevant to a project. Under the _People_ tab, you can add contacts from the client or create new project-specific contacts. You can mark one contact as the "primary" contact.

This allows you to reference all points of contact or your project contacts in your reports. This is great for creating lists or tables of contacts in reports or adding the primary contact's name to a cover page.

# Objective Tracking

Objectives are key to any assessment. As such, they must be carefully tracked and well-understood by the team. The _Objective_ tab helps the team track and prioritize their objectives and breaks them into sub-tasks.

The objective list tracks each objective's status, completion progress, description, and sub-tasks.

By clicking the status bar, the status rotates through several states:

* **Active** – The objective is "live" and work can begin immediately.
* **In Progress** – The team is currently working on the objective.
* **Missed** – For objectives that cannot be completed.
* **On Hold** – For objectives that have a pre-requisite or cannot be worked now.

These status options can be customized in the admin panel if desired.

# Configuring Namecheap

If you use Namecheap to register domain names, Ghostwriter can use Namecheap's API to sync your domain registrations with the Domain Library in Ghostwriter. You can setup this synchronization task to run on a schedule or execute it manually.

On the first run, the task will populate your Domain Library. Subsequent runs will update records and automatically add new domain purchases and expire domain names that have dropped-off your Namecheap account.

Fill-in the configuration values in accordance with your API configuration. All of the relevant details are in your Namecheap dashboard. You can learn more here:

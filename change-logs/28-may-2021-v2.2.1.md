## v2.2.1

{% embed url="https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter/releases/tag/v2.2.1" %}

The following changes are included in this release:

### New Features

* Every page now includes a footer at the bottom of the content that displays the version number of the  Ghostwriter server.

### Fixed

* Findings with no assigned editors will no longer prevent report generation.

### Changed

* Findings in a report now have an `ordering` value that represents their position in the report \(starting at zero with the top finding in the most severe category\).
* Headings throughout the interface are no longer all caps by default \(this could negatively affect readability\).
* Some form elements will no longer appear far apart when the interface is fullscreen on a very high-resolution or wide-screen display.

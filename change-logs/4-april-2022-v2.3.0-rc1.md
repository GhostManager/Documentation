This is the first release candidate for v2.3.0 which features the GraphQL API for testing and feedback.

### Added

* User profiles now have a `role` field for managing permissions in the upcoming GraphQL API
* Added components for upcoming GraphQL API that are only available with _local.yml_ for testing in development environments
  * New Docker container for Hasura GraphQL engine
  * Work-in-progress Hasura metadata for the GraphQL API
  * New `HASURA_ACTION_SECRET` environment variable in env templates
  * New utilities for generating and managing JSON Web Tokens for the GraphQL API
* Added support for block quotes in report templates and WYSIWYG editor
* Added `ProjectInvite` and `ClientInvite` models to support upcoming role-based access controls
* Added a menu option to export a project scope to a text file from the project dashboard
  * Exports only the scope list for easy use with other toolsâ€“e.g., Nmap

### Changed

* Disabled `L10N` by default in favor of using `DATE_FORMAT` for managing the server's preferred date format (closes #193)
* Updated env templates with a `DATE_FORMAT` configuration for managing your preferred format
  * See updated installation documentation on ghostwriter.wiki
* User profiles now only show the user's role, groups, and Ghostwriter user status to the profile owner
* Updated nginx.conf to align it with Mozilla's recommendations for nginx v1.21.1 and OpenSSL 1.1.1l
  * See config: [https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=nginx\&version=1.21.1\&config=intermediate\&openssl=1.1.1l\&ocsp=false\&guideline=5.6](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=nginx\&version=1.21.1\&config=intermediate\&openssl=1.1.1l\&ocsp=false\&guideline=5.6)
* Toast messages for errors are no longer sticky so they do not have to be manually dismissed when covering UI elements
* Domain list table now shows an "Expiry" column and "Categories" column now parses the new `categorization` JSON field data
* Domain list filtering now includes a "Filter Expired" toggle that is on by default
  * Filters out domains with expiration dates in the past and `auto_renew` set to `False` even if the status is set to "Available"
* The table on the domain list page and the menu on the domain details page will no longer disable the check out option if a domain's status is set to "Burned"
* Simplified usage of the `format_datetime` filter
  * Filter now accepts only two arguments: the date and the new format string
  * The format string should use Django values (e.g., `M d, Y`) instead of values translated to Python's standard (e.g., `%b %d, %Y`)
* Simplified usage of the `add_says` filter
  * Filter now accepts only two arguments: the date and an integer

### Deprecated

* v2.2.x usage of the `format_datetime` and `add_days` filters is deprecated in v2.3.0
  * Both filters will no longer accept Python-style `strftime` strings
  * Both filters no longer needs or accepts the `current_format` and `format_str` parameters
  * Templates using the old style will fail linting

### Removed

* Removed "WHOIS Privacy" column on domain list page to make room for more pertinent information

### Fixed

* Bumped `djangorestframework-api-key` to v2.2.0 to fix REST API key creation (closes #197)
* Overrode Django's `get_full_name()` method used for the admin site so the user's proper full name is displayed in history logs
* Fixed project dashboard's "Import Oplog" button not pointing to the correct URL
* Fixed URL conflicts with export links for domains, servers, and findings

### Security

* Restricted edit and delete actions on notes to close possibility of other users editing or deleting notes they do not own

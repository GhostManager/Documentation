# Getting Help with a Problem

## Getting Help

Oh no! Something went wrong and you need help or want to report a problem. The best place to start is right here, the wiki. Many common issues are caused by missing a step in the [Installation section](../getting-started/installation/). Please make sure you have followed each step and seeded the database.

If everything looks good and you're still having problems, pick one of these options.

### Submit an Issue or Bug

Document your problem in a GitHub Issue. Include the following information:

* What you were trying to do
* What you expected to happen
* What actually happened
* Relevant stack traces, screenshots, or other information

### Discuss a Question or Problem

Feel free to open a GiHub Issue to discuss your question, but you may get a quicker response via Slack. If you join the SpecterOps BloodHound Slack team, hop into the \#ghostwriter channel to discuss all things Ghostwriter with the developers and community.
